# The GitHub Flow
The source control managagement standards created by GitHub for their platform is known as the "GitHub Flow". These processes and procedures for continuous integration of software by teams are used widely across the world. When working as a team it can become defficult to manage software development at scale without the implementation of a robust source control management strategy. This document will outline the ways in which you will be adding code changes.

**Steps**
1. [Create a Branch](#_1-create-a-branch)

5. [Deploy](#_5-deploy)

```


## 1. Create a Branch

When working on a task, you should usually create a branch, specifically for the task item. The branch and the task should be linked through the ticket number and the branch name. When creating a new branch to manage a task's work, you should name the branch after the task's ticket number. For example if the Jira task number is `DEV-3219`, then you would name your branch the same value of  `DEV-3219`.

```
✨ git checkout -b DEV-3219    
Switched to a new branch 'DEV-3219'
```

## 2. Add Commits

Add local files to staging environment, then add a commit message for the change set
```
✨ git add .

✨ git commit -m "adding changes"
[DEV-3219 d385437] adding changes
 6 files changed, 93 insertions(+), 19 deletions(-)
```


Push the committed changeset (Note: on the first push to a new branch, you must use the --set-upstream command)
```
✨ git push
fatal: The current branch DEV-3219 has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin DEV-3219

✨ git push --set-upstream origin DEV-3219
```

## 3. Open a Pull Request

After pushing a new branch to GitHub, you will be able to find it in the list of branches. If a branch has recently been pushed to the repo, then you will see the notification with the option to create a new Pull Request. You can also create a pull request on the "Pull requests" tab on the GitHub repository's web page.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <i>Figure A</i>
            <br /><br />
            <img src="images/repo-recent-push.png" width="100%%" height="auto" />
        </td>
        <td>    
            <br />        
            <i>Figure B</i>
            <br /><br />
            <img src="images/create-pr.png" width="100%" height="auto" />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


## 4. Discuss and Review your Code

Reviewers that have been tagged on the Pull Request should reivew the changes in the "Files changed" tab. Here the reviewer can click on or click and drag across multiple lines of code in order to create a comment regarding that particular code section. You can submit your comment as a single comment with the "Add a single comment" button. Or you can click "Start a review" which will allow you to Approve or Request changes on the Pull Request.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <i>Figure C</i>
            <br /><br />
            <img src="images/review-changes.png" width="100%%" height="auto" />
        </td>
        <td>    
            <br />        
            <i>Figure D</i>
            <br /><br />
            <img src="images/add-code-comment.png" width="100%" height="auto" />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

As the developer, you will be notified of comments. On the Pull Request you can add comments to notify the reviewer that you are addressing their concerns. After you have committed your new changes requested by the reviewer, you may click "Resolve conversation" which will signify that the change has been committed.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <i>Figure E</i>
            <br /><br />
            <img src="images/comment-back.png" width="100%%" height="auto" />
        </td>
        <td>    
            <br />        
            <i>Figure F</i>
            <br /><br />
            <img src="images/resolve-conversation.png" width="100%" height="auto" />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>



## 5. Deploy

After reviewers are satisfied with the branche's changeset, they will Approve the pull request. This will notify the developer that their code is ready to be merged. If there are multiple reviewers, it is wize that the developer makes sure that all reviewers have had a chance to review the changes before merging, even if there is already one approval.


<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <i>Figure G</i>
            <br /><br />
            <img src="images/add-review.png" width="100%%" height="auto" />
        </td>
        <td>    
            <br />        
            <i>Figure H</i>
            <br /><br />
            <img src="images/merge-pull-request.png" width="100%" height="auto" />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
